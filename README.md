For the reason everyone know, the google search often failed when some content is refused by the GFW in china. 
Recentlly, I find if I change the browser's url from http://xxx.google.xxx to https://xxx.google.xxx will get a good result, unless the result page content of your search is forbidded by the GFW too. 
It's very bad experiance to do that with your hands eyery time when the http can't be used, so I white this simple plugin to do that.

The folder "chrome" is for the chrome browser.
